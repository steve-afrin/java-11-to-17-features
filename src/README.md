# Java 11 to 17 Features

This multi-module project is designed to introduce new features of
the Java language introduced between long-term support versions of
Java 11 and 17. Most of the features are introduced from Java
Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), but one feature is actually a bug fix
to the JDK for the Date/Time API and is a precursor to a much more
comprehensive update coming in Java 19.

Use each module of this project independently to read the README
files, examine the code, and play with any available test files to
explore the new features and see how they work and what they offer.

As a very quick, short summary, here are the new features introduced
to Java 17 as presented in this project:

* Switch Expression
* NullPointerException Enhancement
* Text Blocks
* Records
* Pattern Matching for instanceof
* Days Periods Support
* Sealed Classes
