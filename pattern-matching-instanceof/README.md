# Pattern Matching for instanceof

* Java 16 (previewed in JDKs 14 and 15)
* [JEP 394](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/394)

Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for the
`instanceof` operator. Pattern matching allows common logic in a
program, namely the conditional extraction of components from
objects, to be expressed more concisely and safely.
