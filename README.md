# Java 11 to 17 Features

There are many, many changes and enhancements to the Java language
and the JVM between long-term support versions 11 and 17. While it
is too much to demonstrate and discuss every single one of those
changes and enhancements, this project highlights some of the
new features that might be of most interest to the majority of Java
developers.

In an attempt to introduce all the different features in a clean,
clear way, this project is a collection of modules in which each
module is its own individual explanation (with its own README) for
the feature covered by that module.

The modules for new features in Java 17 presented in this project
are:

* [Days Periods Support](days-periods/README.md)
* [`NullPointerException` enhancement](nullpointerexception-enhancement/README.md)
* [Pattern Matching for `instanceof`](pattern-matching-instanceof/README.md)
* [Record Classes and Interfaces](records/README.md)
* [Sealed Classes](sealed-classes/README.md)
* [`switch` Expressions](switch-expressions/README.md)
* [Text Blocks](text-blocks/README.md)
